To run BearPaint 4.1 on linux there is no executable so you must run main.py yourself.

Make sure to install all the dependencies: **pygame,** **autopygui**

If you want to save your work, run these in terminal: **sudo apt-get install scrot** and **sudo apt-get install python3-tk**

BearPaint 4.1 has been tested with ubuntu 20.04.2.0 and xubuntu 21.04.
